Starter application for nodejs web servers/clients.

This includes a setup for staticaly served files in the "public" where the front end assets and minified front end app are kept.  A folder called "server" is for the pre-minified front end app and the rest endpoints.  The test folder holds the jasmine tests for both the front and back end.

Useful commands:
npm start - start the web server and static file hosting
npm test - run linting and tests
npm sass - compile styles into public directory

Remember to change:
package.json - rename project
this readme - all of it, be helpful
